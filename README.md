Python practice to understand fundamental of Encryption and Decoding thorugh python text.

Initial Setup:

User opens the application.
The default mode is set to "Encode".
Encoding a Message:

The user inputs the plaintext "HELLO" into the "Plain Text" field.
The user sets the shift key to 3.
The "Cipher Text" field automatically updates to show the encoded message "KHOOR".
Switching to Decode Mode:

The user changes the mode to "Decode".
The "Cipher Text" field contains "KHOOR".
The "Plain Text" field automatically updates to show the decoded message "HELLO".
Steps with Images:
Initial Setup (Encode Mode):
Plain Text: (empty)
Cipher Text: (empty)
Shift Key: (empty)

Encoding (Input Plaintext "HELLO" with Shift Key 3):
Plain Text: "HELLO"
Shift Key: "3"
Cipher Text: "KHOOR" (automatically updated)

Switching to Decode Mode:
Mode: "Decode"
Cipher Text: "KHOOR"
Plain Text: "HELLO" (automatically updated)
